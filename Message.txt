We tried are best as we are newbie in this we made it. We wanted to add alot of things but due to our college we were unable to execute alot of stuffs but yes we can add things like jobs/internship as startups struggle. It will be good as everything will be in one place. Our idea was social media connecting between investors and startup also for investor there is feature for analysis of their investment and the investor can see the ppt or annual report uploaded by the startups thats all.
